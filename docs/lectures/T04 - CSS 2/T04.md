# How to include Local font `(skip)`

- Download google font - [Mali](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mali)
- Extract and copy font files (TTF) into local folders.
- Use the `@font-face` rule
  - (`@` means special instructions for the browser, not directly related to styling.)

---

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: myLocalFont;
  src: url(./font/Mali-Regular.ttf);
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: myLocalFont;
  src: url(./font/Mali-Bold.ttf);
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

- Note that event if you don't have the rule for `bold`, you can still see bold font. This 'bolding' is done by browser (see [faux bold](https://alistapart.com/article/say-no-to-faux-bold/)).

---

# Hosted font

- [Chakra Petch](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chakra+Petch)
- Choose `Regular 400` and `Bold 700`
- Add `@import`
  - Add another css into the current sheet

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Chakra+Petch:wght@400;700&display=swap");
```

---

# Custom Properties

- Declare custom properties at the `:root` pseudo-class. For a HTML document, this is `<html>`

```css
:root {
  --main-bg-color: brown;
}
```

- To use the property, do the following.

```css
element {
  background-color: var(--main-bg-color);
}
```

---

# Layout

- Block
- Inline-block
- Flex
- Grid
- Float

---

# Block vs Inline

- `block` elements appear one below the other
- `inline` elements appear beside one another like the individual words in a paragraph.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/dyzLovq

---

# Block and Inline - Margin and Padding (Skip)

- Block elements
  - Can add margins and padding on all four sides.
- Inline elements
  - Can add space to the left and right.
  - **Cannot** add height to the top or bottom padding or margin.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/bGrJgMo

---

# Inline vs Inline-Block `(skip)`

- `inline-block` allows one to set a width and height on the element.

  - The top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with `display: inline` they are not.

- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/zYdXGwE

---

# Flex

- Lay things out in one dimension
  - Either as a row or as a column
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/ExvJjMR
- Alos, see this [guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

  ![bg contain right:50%](./img/flex_terminology.png)

---

# Grid `(skip)`

- Grid Layout is designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/wvqZWQP
- Also, see this [guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

---

# Float `(skip)`

- Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the block level elements that follow it in normal flow.
- The floated element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the surrounding content floats around it.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/porBarb

---

# Positioning `(skip)`

- Static
- Relative
- Absolute
- Fixed
- Sticky

---

# Static `(skip)`

- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
- The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `z-index` properties have no effect.
- This is the default value.

---

# Relative `(skip)`

- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document
  - then offset relative to itself based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
- The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/VwzNYNX

---

# Absolute `(skip)`

- The element is removed from the normal document flow.
- It is positioned relative to its closest `relative` ancestor.
  - Its final position is determined by the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/bGrJNPy

---

# Fixed `(skip)`

- It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport
  - Except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than `none`.
- Its final position is determined by the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/wvqZBVb

---

# Sticky `(skip)`

- Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
- The element is treated as `relative` positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as `fixed` positioned.
- https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/GRvLQXb

---

# Responsive design

- Flex: https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/dyzEpyY
- Media query: https://codepen.io/nnnpooh/pen/XWaQZvE

---

# Media query `(skip)`

- Media types
  - `all`, `print`, `screen`, `speech`
- Logical operators
  `not`, `and`, `only`
- Examples
  - `@media print { ... }`
  - `@media (hover: hover) { ... }`
  - `@media (max-width: 12450px) { ... }`
  - `@media (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }`
